Description:

Section A: 
The pseudocode used initialises the musicPlayer, playlist, tracklist, repeat feature, search feature, and add/remove feature. The musicPlayer then starts playing the songs on the playlist. You can search for songs, and you can play back the tracks, and lastly the choice to add or remove tracks is available, if necessary.

Section B:
The python code provides the user a window that displays the current song playing as well as an option to pause/play and select the next song to play or a previously played song, provided through a click of a button frame for each function.
